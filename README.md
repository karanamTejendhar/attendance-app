android attendance app

This Attendance app software is developed for
everyone who wants to save time in taking attendance.it
actually works on some unique code which will be
decided by the user(who wants to take attendance).

Since we can have one system in one rectangular
box , the use case diagrams has been divided into
two parts, namely the AppServer , which covers
server side of the attendance app, and the Android
Application, the client side / interface of the
attendance app. Each diagram has its own
prospective users and use cases, this is a very
efficient way to represent the functioning of the
application .
